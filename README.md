# Hi, I'm Beata 👋

I'm a Data Scientist passionate about building useful, realistic solutions that connect machine learning with real business value.

I specialize in:

- 📊 **Forecasting & Time Series** (FMCG, demand prediction, seasonality analysis)
- 💬 **NLP & Semantic Search** (BERT, TF-IDF, quote matching, fallback modeling)
- 🏦 **Credit Scoring & Model Monitoring** (WoE, IV, PSI, scorecards)
- 📈 **Business Data Analysis** (EDA, insight extraction, stakeholder-ready storytelling)

---

## 📐 What I do

- Build and explain scoring cards using WoE/IV, logistic regression, and score scaling  
- Monitor model drift using PSI and evaluate performance over time  
- Conduct in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) with clear business recommendations  
- Improve predictions using hybrid models (structured data + customer feedback via NLP)  
- Simulate real-world projects end-to-end using Python, SQL, and Databricks  
- Communicate findings through dashboards, clean code, and documentation
